# Generate Attribute Profile

The attribute profiles for LiDAR is applied based on the research work of [Dr.Liao](https://telin.ugent.be/~wliao/Partial_Reconstruction/). How to use the code can refer to this
```matlab
num_scales = 2;
MPNeachpca = getmorphprofiles(DSM, 'euclidean', 'square', num_scales);
MPN = cat(3, MPNeachpca, DSM);
```
